# Library-Management-System

This system can be used to regulate a virtual library. This is a very basic version of the library with the following functionalities :
    
    1. A super admin who can add himself/herself directly in the DB.
    2. The super admin and other admins can perform the following operations :    
        i. Add/Remove User
        ii. Update Regular Users to Admins
        iii. Add/Remove Books
    3. The regular user can perform the following operations :  
        i. Issue/Reissue/Return Books
    4. The users will be added with a default password. 
       When they login for the first time , they will be given an option to reset their password.
       Password has been masked for security reasons.
       
At present I have used old technologies with no framework.It is a part of my learning process. 
It makes me realise the importance of the newer technologies and frameworks (which I will be using in the later versions of this project).
I have used JSP,Servlets and Core Java for this version of the project.

A lot of new features will be added in the subsequent versions and those will be updated regularly here. 
As of now it is not a hosted project.Once hosted, I will also provide the link here.
